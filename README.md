# Pokedex #
This is an assessment given by [Doctalk](https://doctalk.com/) developed by Maitri Modi.

Given Requirements

- The goal of this assessment is to build a basic React Native application which demonstrates common tasks such as fetching data from API and displaying them in a table form.

Assessment checklist

1. From the PokéAPI, retrieve a list of 20 Pokémon and display them in a table.
2. Each Pokémon row should display its “front_default” image, its name, and all of its types.
3. Store the information in an array in state. Use the following format:
  - [
      {
      "name": "bulbasaur",
      "types": ["grass", "poison"],
      "image_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/132.png"
      },
      ...
     ]
